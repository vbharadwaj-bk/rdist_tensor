# Distributed Randomized Algorithms for Sparse Tensor CP Decomposition 

This repository contains work in progress for randomized leverage-based algorithms for sparse tensor decomposition
that can be deployed to a cluster and run at scale on thousands of CPU cores. It uses OpenMP, MPI (Message Passing Interface),
and OpenBLAS for local linear algebra.
